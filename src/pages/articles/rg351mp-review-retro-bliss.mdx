<br />

Anbernic has been regarded as a strong contender in the retro hand-held gaming market for some time, at least, if online sentiment is anything to go by. While their more recent products seem to garner mixed reviews, their older catalog seems to be adored by most. A handheld belonging to such group, the RG351MP, released last year among a sea of competitors and received glowing praise across the board. After spending time with it myself, it’s easy to see why.

<br />

Waving the flags of affordability, newcomer friendliness, and build quality, the device manages to impress across the board - regardless of its slightly outdated and somewhat overused chipset. It’s no secret that with the current global shortages, companies like Anbernic have been trying to stick to re-using older stock while the demand for new chipsets can catch up, resulting in devices like the RG351MP.

<br />

With a competitive market such as retro gaming handhelds, though, does the device do enough to stand out and justify its slightly higher price tag? Would it be more sensible for someone looking to dive into this ecosystem to go for a cheaper offering like Powkiddy or splash the cash and reach for something like the Odin Pro?

<br />

## A note on software

<br />

Although I am not taking it into account for the review, due to the awesome open source community alternatives, the stock software shipped with the device, Emulation Station, is passable. I've encounted a few tiny interface bugs, but it's usable out of the box with minimal configuration, providing you supply the games.

<br />

If you're looking to branch out and install some custom software, I would suggest <a href="https://amberelec.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline text-nord-350 hover:text-nord-375">AmberELEC</a> (formerly 351ELEC). Retro Game Corp has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh5W7vw9Lqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline text-nord-350 hover:text-nord-375">an amazing install</a> guide that should have you up and gaming in no time.

<br />

## Build Quality

<br />

In an offering of three colors: Ocean Blue, Mint Green and Matte Black, the device's casing is a premium feeling aluminum metal, giving it a great weighty heft. I went with black, just to match other similar devices I own, but all three colors look stunning when applied to the metal chassis.

<br />

Buttons are engraved with their design, rather than stuck on with stickers (a practice that used to be common in this market). The analogue sticks sit in my preferred position for a handheld device - mirrored on either side, towards the bottom. The sticks themselves are indented deep into the casing to allow for a gorgeous flush lineup with the rest of the device's buttons, making it easy to pocket and hard to accidentally catch on something.

<br />

The d-pad feels tight and less mushy than most, and the shoulder buttons are clicky and satisfying, if a little bit loud. The back of the device has two thick rubber strips running parallel to each other, giving your fingers a comfortable resting spot during use.

<br />

Finally, the screen is crisp and offers a treat for the eyes in all its retro glory. Colors look like they might jump out of the screen with how much they pop, and the size is perfect for the older generation of consoles.

<br />

It's incredibly easy to underestimate the amazing feel a metal casing can have. I struggle to find any flaws with the build itself. The shoulder buttons are a little  loud for my liking, and one of the rubber pads on my device was slightly misaligned. Overall, the build quality is incredible - a tough feat to accomplish for the price point.

<br />

## Power and gaming performance

<br />

I don't want to beat around the bush here; it's a shame that this device is using the RK3326. Don't get me wrong, it's a great chip and hasn't let me down yet but, it's old. For a newcomer, it probably won't matter much. But for anyone versed in the retro emulation scene, I can almost guarantee that you already own a device with this chip.

<br />

With the above in mind, the device can handle everything up to and including PS1 titles. You may be able to push some N64 and Dreamcast titles if you squeeze hard enough, but most games in those generations will lead to stuttering, slowdown and audio hitching. While it can handle most DS games without an issue, most of the library is difficult or even impossible to play without a touchscreen.

<br />

While jumping between many games and trying to stress the device, I found virtually no issues with performance or screen tearing. Any person hoping to play their favorite childhood retro games from the Gameboy, Playstation One or earlier consoles will find it a joy to play, leaving little to be desired.

<br />

## Summary

<br />

The RG351MP is an incredible retro gaming handheld for both newcomers and veterans alike. The stunning metal casing gives it a weighty, premium feel and it performs as well as can be expected from an older CPU.

<br />

While it may not be the king-pin of the market right now, this device will be a solid, reliable choice for a few years to come, providing a great experience with little to no configuration required. It's biggest downfall is its outdated CPU choice that comes off as a profit grab at a time of short supply for newer chips.
