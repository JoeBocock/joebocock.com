Over twenty years ago, Steve Jobs took to a stage in front of a modest crowd and announced the soon-to-be digital music behemoth, the iPod. During this presentation, Jobs provided many reasons why a step in the direction of music would be smart, stating "No one has really found the recipe yet, for digital music".

<br />

Storing a staggering 1,000 songs, the original iPod was the first stepping stone that led Apple to having a monumental impact on the music industry. Providing people with the first truly convenient way to enjoy music on the go, not just in size but in software usability. Sales for the device peaked in 2008, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod#Sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline text-nord-350 hover:text-nord-375">making up 42% of Apple's revenue for the first fiscal quarter.</a>

<br />

As is common with Apple, the popularity of the hardware was lifted in part by the release of the iTunes store in 2003. The pair came swinging into the mid two thousands by prioritising usability and they quickly became the market leaders, though the final nail in the coffin of the iPod's competitors was the seamless App Store integration.

<br />

Thanks in no small part to the aforementioned App Store, it will remain the first widely accessible do-it-all style device for a group of younger generations. Perhaps for this reason, and the nostalgia tied to it, reading the news of the discontinuation may have been a downer - as it certainly was for me.

<br />

Upon taking a step back, this decision doesn't come as a surprise. Apple has been knowingly cannibalizing the iPod for some time through the continued improvement of the iPhone and push of services like Apple Music, leaving only price savings as a reason to consider an iPod.

<br />

Some may argue that the true iPod line ended back in 2017 when Apple ceased production of both the Shuffle and Nano, marking the death of the music-only device offering from the company. Regardless of which was most impactful as a whole, it's hard to deny the mark it left on the music world.

Pivoting from the undeniable positive impacts the iPod has had, it wasn't always smooth sailing. With music so readily available through YouTube, Spotify, and other similar services, it can be easy to forget the huge amount of people that used to (or still do) pirate their music. In 2006, Juniper Research found that around 30% of people illegally downloaded their music - <em>specifically for their iPod</em>.

<br />

Regardless of the influence the iPod has had, both positive and negative, it's fun to reminisce about personal experiences with it. I remember sitting in my childhood bedroom listening to Panic! At The Disco on repeat, or standing in the school hallways with friends taking turns playing Brick. While the devices we play it on may change throughout the years, we owe a lot of the convenience of modern music to the iPod.
