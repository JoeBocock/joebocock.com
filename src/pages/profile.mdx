I&#39;m a software engineer living in the UK. During my spare time, I develop & write for this website, mainly just for fun. My toolbox contains many useful things, but the sharpest are PHP, Laravel, JavaScript, Vue, React, MySQL and Docker.

<br />

If you were looking for a short sentence to describe me, I&#39;d say <span className='italic'>&#34;passionately pursuing enjoyment in everything I do, whilst constantly moving the goalposts&#34;</span>. A complete and utter desire to learn is hard-coded into my DNA, and it serves as my drive in everything I do. A want for knowledge should come with the understanding that there&#39;s always more to learn though, and that&#39;s an idea I&#39;m very familiar with.

<br />

Technology and a love for it course through my veins, and I suspect it always will, considering it always has. From the satisfying post beep of a newly built machine to the look of an all green test suite, I&#39;ll never be numb to the immediate dopamine it all provides. There&#39;s a special place in my heart for gaming, as a fairly socially reclusive child it was a healthy escape that still brings me joy - though I rarely have the time.

I joined the world of software after spending a few years in hardware repair. While the call to break out the soldering iron and build something still enters my mind often, writing code is something of an art to me and one that I very much love. After finding myself in the right place, at the right time and with the right people - I landed a Junior Software Developer job. <i>Dream come true</i> still doesn&#39;t do it justice.

<br />

Cut to three years (and promotions) later, and I decided it was time to move on. My life started to form around the remote aspect of my job but I didn&#39;t want the change to be temporary. Turns out my love for <span className='bg-black text-white px-2 rounded-sm inline-block'>The Office</span> only applied to the TV show and I wanted something more, homely?

<br />

Another year later and I&#39;m a remote Software Engineer working with incredible people, building amazing things and doing it all with awesome tech. The old clich√© of finding a job you love and never working a day in your life has turned out to ring true for me, and I&#39;m very thankful.

<br />f TL;DR - Another nerd doing nerdy things, one keystroke at a time.
