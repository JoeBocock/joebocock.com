                I feel like these introductions are normally cheesy, an attempt
                at

                or too much information at once. Or maybe the mere fact that I
                acknowledged this paragraph like this makes it cheesier than
                anything else I could've said. Huh.
            </p>

                I'm not great at introducing myself as you can probably tell.

                A quick note about this website before I blabber some more about
                myself. There's a couple easter eggs, hidden secrets and nifty
                things I've included. Some developed by myself, others are

                I've pulled in. Have a nosey around and see what you can find.

                Developing from an early
                <a class="option" @click="requestConfetti()">love</a> of
                hardware, my passion for tech has been something that's followed
                me my entire life. With my first exposure to a desktop
                environment being powered by a
                <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_III"

                    >Pentium III</a
                >, I was off to a speedy start.
            </p>

            <p>
                I should probably mention my preferred dev stack. MacOS
                development with a Vue frontend powered by a Laravel backend. My
                work based experience revolves more around CodeIgniter though.

                    Ever wonder what it would be like to navigate websites via
                    the command line? Switch to desktop and read this paragraph
                    again to find out.

                <span v-else>
                    Fancy navigating my site via 'command line?' I've written a
                    handler for it into my Vue input component. Go ahead and
                    <i>cat</i> or <i>nano</i> any of the sections listed in my
                    navbar. It's kinda a treat for actually reading this far.
                    Just simply click underneath the final HR on the page or
                    <a class="option" @click="focusInput()">here</a> and start
                    typing.

                Thank you for taking the time to read my inane typings. If for
                whatever reason, you'd like to get in contact with me, please
                use the email below. I should reply farely quickly but I'm
