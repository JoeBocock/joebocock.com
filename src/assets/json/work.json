    "cardios": "Cardios was more of an experiment in new technology turned fun project. To put it simply, it's a note taking desktop app built with Electron. It's a show of what I could do before I fully embraced the understandings of Javascript. I've improved a lot since its creation and would love to rewrite the entire thing in Vue, should I ever find the time.",
    "personal": "The very site you're looking at. Currently in its third iteration, I'm happy with the way it's turning out. Built with Vue, Vue-Cli and written with 95% of my own CSS, it's definitely my labour of love. I think it's a strong representation of at least my front-end capabilities and hopefully reflects my data oriented approach.",
    "codepen": "My CodePen doesn't have a massive amount of content right now but I think the stuff that's there is some of the best visual work I've done. While it's definitely not my strong suit, I'm happy with what I've got.",
    "other": "I'm plagued by a very prevalent issue in the developer community. I'm an 'architect' that becomes so concerned with <i>how</i> something should be done that I rarely ever finish. There's new projects popping up all the time on my Github so keep an eye out there if you're interested."
